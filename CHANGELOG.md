# SheetFlow v2 Changelog

## M01 - Production Foundation (in progress)

Branch `feat/m01-foundation`, cut from `feat/m00-foundation` at `66f5059`.

### Proof architecture — resolves D1

- Added `src/config/features.ts`: env-backed flags for `caseStudies`,
  `testimonials`, `trustLogos`, `results`. All default to `false`.
- Added `src/content/proof.ts`: the single source of truth for customer-facing
  claims. Entries are a discriminated union on `status`; only `'verified'`
  entries carry claim fields, so an unverified metric has nowhere to be typed.
  The `published*()` selectors are the only surface the UI reads.
- Added `src/components/ui/ProofPlaceholder.tsx`.
- Removed every fabricated trust signal: the six invented trust-strip names and
  the three invented case studies with their invented metrics and quotes.
- Relabelled the AIDashboard mock from "Live / Updated 2s ago" to
  "Product preview / Sample data".

### Design system

- Ran the `TOKENS.md` drift check for the first time. `brand-os/tokens.ts` was
  the stale file: it still held the pre-rebrand indigo/violet palette while the
  site had moved to the logo's blue + gold under `0920b03`. Corrected the
  source-of-truth files to the shipped values.
- Added a correctly named `gold` scale and the missing `cyan` scale. `violet`
  retained as a deprecated alias so all 34 existing usages keep resolving.

### Accessibility

- Raised the new proof components' small-label contrast from 4.26:1 to 8.31:1.

### Commits

| Hash | Description |
|---|---|
| `a197efc` | `feat(m01): proof architecture with verification enforced in the type system` |
| `44440e6` | `fix(design-system): reconcile brand-os tokens with the shipped palette` |
| `e5cbb3b` | `fix(a11y): raise label contrast to AA in the new proof components` |

### Verification

- `npm run type-check` — exit 0
- `npm run lint` — exit 0 (9 pre-existing warnings, none introduced)
- `npm run build` — exit 0, 8/8 routes
- Bundle: 1,048,349 bytes across 13 client chunks (321 kB gzipped) — unchanged
  from the M00 baseline
- Build output confirmed free of every removed name

### Deliberately not done

- The four founder-named engagements (R3S Realty, Saraswati Dental, Sparc
  Physiotherapy, Elevate WPC) were not published. They could not be
  corroborated anywhere in this repository or the surrounding workspace, and
  are held as `pending` entries carrying no claims.
- No client logo assets were generated. Generating one for an unverified
  company would convert a text placeholder into a forged endorsement.
- The 34 `violet-*` usages were not migrated to `gold-*`.
- 14 pre-existing `ink-400` small-text call sites still measure below AA.

## M00 - Foundation
- Created backup branch
- Created feature branch
- Repository inventory completed
- Repository structure reviewed
- Execution contract adopted (external governance)
- Archived 11 reference folders into `Documentation/Archive/` (118 files, all renames, no content change)
- Added `Documentation/Approved/` as a pointer to external CoWork governance
- Added root `.gitignore` and `CHANGELOG.md`
- Repaired 30 broken link targets in `MASTER_INDEX.md`
- Repaired the build so `npm run build` passes with no manual flags

### Commits

| Hash | Description |
|---|---|
| `5e8ef5d` | `fix(hero): raise headline legibility over background video` |
| `5b3b8ba` | `chore(m00): archive reference material, repair index links and build` |

### Verification at close of M00

- `npm run type-check` — exit 0
- `npm run lint` — exit 0 (9 pre-existing warnings, none introduced)
- `npm run build` — exit 0, 19.8s, 8/8 routes, default Turbopack path

### Deliberately not done in M00

- `10_Final_Website/` was not relocated, to preserve the Vercel root directory setting
- `.eslintrc.json` retained pending the tooling milestone
- Deployment reconciliation deferred by founder instruction
- Fabricated marketing claims remain unresolved and still live in production
